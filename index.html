        <p> I was born in Nairobi, Kenya and i lived there till i was 18 and i then moved to USA to further my studies
            and
            achieve the American Dream.
            I always think about my family back home & i miss being in my homecountry. I guess that's why i've created
            this website to talk a little more about Kenya, home to the famous record-breaking marathon runners(such as Eliud Kipchoge)

    <h2> Cool Facts </h2>
    <div id="facts">
        <ul>
            <li> Kenya is home to the big 5: <span id="animal"><strong>The Lion, Leopard, Rhino , Elephant & Cape
                        Buffalo</strong> </span></li>

            </li>
            
            <li> <span id = "list">A part of the Lake Victoria, the worldâ€™s second largest freshwater lake, flows through Kenya. The
                country
                shares the lake with Tanzania and Uganda. Lake Superior in North America is the largest of all the
                freshwater lakes in the world. <span></li>
            <li>Lamu Island is the oldest continuously inhabited settlement in the country. The town was founded in
                1370.
                Interestingly, more than 6,000 donkeys are used for transporting goods and people through the town. The
                streets of the town are narrow. Believe it or not, there are just two cars on the island and one of
                these is
                an ambulance for the donkeys!!</li>
            <li> There are more than 45 languages spoken in the country but we have a national
                language-<em> Swahili</em></li>
            <li> Interestingly, Kenya could possibly be the birthplace of humans. This assumption is supported by the
                fact
                that the bones of one of the earliest human ancestors ever found were discovered in Kenya

            <li> We're one of the fastest growing economies in Africa </li>
            <li> Sportswise,we are known for long distance running and rugby </li>
